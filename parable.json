The park features a dazzling waterfall, with a pedestrian bridge crossing the Reedy River just downstream. But, recently the once beloved Reedy River has been a source of sickness and death. The water is infected with a parasite, Giardia intestinalis, or Giardia, which causes diarrhea and vomiting, which leads to dehydration and in some cases, death. Because of worsening water quality and lack of access to purification methods. there have been at least 200 cases of Giardia in the Downtown Greenville area alone. the infection has primarily affected children, as they unknowingly drink from the waterfalls and contract the parasite. Prices of antibiotics are skyrocketing as the death toll climbs higher each day. "

The resulting short-range explosion left all within the facility dead, and the fallout released spread in an estimated elliptical radius, extending up to twelve miles northwards and eight miles towards the south. Officials are advising against leaving shelter for another few days. Presently, three days after the incident, the highest estimated death counts are in Davidson and just west of Cornelius. Researchers speculate this to be because of the good weather increasing a characteristically high quantity of pedestrian traffic, combined with many Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools being out for summer. While currently unclear, at least five hundred deaths have been reported and this number is expected to rise dramatically as more individuals experience acute radiation poisoning. The delayed warnings and sirens are currently under investigation and are presently attributed to equipment malfunction. Officials are increasing the security at the Catawba Duke Nuclear Plant in fear of copycat attacks, while the motive of the original group is unclear. The bodies have yet to be found and recovered, but footage suggests that they used a combination of homebrew incendiaries and explosives. "

As part of an effort to curb unnecessary federal spending, the Butner Federal Medical Center (FMC), residing on the ground of the Butner Federal Correctional Institution, received its check. With limited money to continue operations, the FMC will close its doors on November 1. A spokesperson from Butner Federal Correctional Institution did not respond to comment when asked about the future awaiting patients from the FMC. Operational since 1995, the Federal Medical Center serviced notable inmates ranging from John Hinckley Jr., to Bernie Madoff, to Theodore Kaczynski. Julius Graham, professor of Law & Society at Duke University views the closure as \u201ca clear sign the federal government no longer views incarceration as restorative in any sense of the word, if it ever did. Now, President Donner has essentially doomed millions of prisoners to inhumane deaths by treatable conditions.\u201d In his radio statement, Donner praised Congress for \u201cpassing a bill that will finally divert money to the American people and not to those unfit for society.\u201d"

No record of the number of inhabitants in Lucama prior to the fires exists, making it unclear how many possible survivors there could be given the suspected number of deaths. <br><br>Surprisingly, out of everything that was consumed by the fire, several large metal art structures remained untouched. These art pieces, as referred to as by one police officer on the scene, are colorful structures made from scrap metal and machine parts, with all of them functioning similarly to a pinwheel toy.  <br><br>The same police officer stated that the reflective parts of some of the metal art pieces most likely added to the sensation these individuals were feeling as they were setting the fires.  <br><br>\u201cThe light reflecting onto these metal art structures that are standing up to fifty feet tall must\u2019ve captivated them in some way,\u201d The officer said.

I am always reminded that we are all neighbors and we are all trying to survive.\u201d The cholera outbreak started about two months ago and has spread while the community has tried to contain and purify any remaining contaminated food and water. The tornados that have sprung up this week have added to the number of people left homeless, sick, and in need of resources. Virginia has lost all semblance of state maintained infrastructure, so it is up to individual communities to stay together and take care of maintenance and necessities. Maria Nicely\u2019s statements are a reminder of how fortunate our community is to be so small and out of the way.

Dr. Lory Dale, once part of the Food and Drug Administration, explained her reasoning to us in an interview last Thursday within the previously defunct Kennywood Theme Park. \"Pyro addicts have wreaked havoc on this country, and I'm not trying to defend any of what they've done. But what people don't realize is a lot of them are kids looking for a way to make something for themselves with what little power they feel they have, even if that means burning everything to the ground. Whether they want community, power, or some combination of both, they take the pill. We're here to provide a way out.\" Dale took us to Musical Express, a spinning carousel of flashing lights and exciting music. From where we stood, we could see some addicts on board, screaming and singing along, but no fires. \"It's too expensive to run the full park with the security and other expenses\" Dale continued, \"but as long as we get the flashier rides going and keep a couple of 'break' rooms for those craving bigger hits, it works. But I want to make this clear: it is a lot less expensive to prevent these things than to try and ease them later. There is still a lot of work to be done.\" "

Eye-witness reports state that some rioters appeared high, \u201calmost insane looking\u201d as one witness described them, while others were sober, pillaging and vandalizing the historic monument. The use of drugs in this crime is unconfirmed. <br><br>Police arrived at the scene at roughly 4:30 AM; most rioters had left by then. While a small private security force had been stationed at Independent Hall that evening, they have since gone missing. Police are conducting a city-wide search for the missing guards. <br><br>Security camera footage shows rioters breaking through the security measures designed to protect the Liberty Bell, rolling the bell out of the building and approximately 0.7 miles to the Delaware River, and then dumping the Bell in the river. The Bell has not yet been recovered. While police were stationed nearby, none noticed the historic bell being stolen. When asked about this crime, a PPD correspondent stated \u201cWe are spread thin and currently focusing on areas of the city facing more violence.\u201d <br><br>The loss of one of Philadelphia\u2019s most recognizable icons comes during a severe increase in violent crime. Police are overwhelmed; however, PPD is also facing accusations of corruption. These accusations continue to mount as multiple communal leaders who had openly discussed police corruption have recently gone missing. PPD did not comment when asked about this matter. "

A group of young to middle-aged people committed arson, setting Back Bay Street in Boston, Massachusetts on fire. Witnesses say that an 18-year-old female, who is the suspected leader, appeared to be giving orders to the other arsonists. There are rumors that she is dangerous: she is a \u201csharer.\u201d According to local scientists, sharers can experience other people\u2019s pain as if it were their own. The city police suspect that the rest of the group may be \u201csharers\u201d as well. They left a note in the middle of the burned-down street saying, \u201cThere will be no more pain.\u201d Local authorities suspect that the \u201csharers\u201d are trying to eliminate non-sharers in order to live pain-free. Similar attacks have been reported in other northern states such as Maine, New York, and Connecticut. These arson attacks have risen alongside an influx of southern Americans moving to the north. Due to this apparent correlation, there is a political war about accepting Southerners. Do we accept the southerners, or, as some people say, \u201csend them back to where they came from?\u201d Further, people in Boston and the greater north argue that the Southerners are stealing their jobs. Southerners are more desperate to accept any kind of work, even slave work, at cheap prices. There are currently debates as to whether or not Massachusetts will build a wall to prevent further \u201cSouthern\u201d damage. More on this developing news story. "

Many people have untreated injuries, making it easy for the bacteria to enter the wounds and spread in the body. This disease is incredibly painful and can be deadly if not treated by a doctor. With people unable to afford medical care, many cases have been left untreated, causing the bacteria to spread. The disease spreads fast, with the bacteria eating away at the skin and muscles fairly quickly. With no real way of keeping the wounds clean and unexposed, the number of cases has increased drastically and is said to only get worse. Many are desperate to survive and have taken matters into their own hands, picking at the scabs and wounds that the bacteria leave behind. This has only made matters worse, as it has increased the spread of the bacteria. As of now, there are reported cases of more than half of the homeless people carrying this disease and even more cases of people who have died because of it."

Eventually once all have been labored to insanity and subsequently eaten, a new batch is brought in.<br><br>        Luckily, those who live in the submerged districts are protected from the Paints, who now wander aimlessly on the barren outskirts searching for anything to burn.

The many alleyways behind restaurant kitchens have become breeding grounds of disease for rats. These rats carry Hantavirus and Rat Bite Fever, both fatal diseases. Transmitted by bite, these viruses require immediate diagnosis and treatment. Resident, Matthew Holmes, began to notice the influx of rats at the back of his walled home. Holmes states, \u201cOne day I noticed a few as I was taking out my trash and every day since they have either doubled or tripled. Someone\u2019s got to do something about this.\u201d Emmet County authorities claim they have been seeking extermination chemicals to be manufactured and expedited to the city. The death toll in Harbor Springs has hit close to 300 residents and 56 unidentified bodies. Harbor Springs Hospital can not accommodate any more patients at this time and was unable to make a statement.

The fire quickly spread through the building and across the street into a nearby apartment complex. Reports also say that the fire began around 11:30 pm and began spreading across the street around midnight. Eleven members of the apartment complex were found dead early that morning and hundreds of others living in the apartments were injured with severe burns. The three intoxicated teenagers, armed with guns, were later reported robbing and then burning several closed restaurants in the area. This is the third major reported pyromaniac burning in the state of Indiana in the past three weeks. The drug has since been banned throughout the state, but these laws have not protected against recent attacks in and outside the state. Other midwest cities and states have reported similar attacks over the past month. The ages of the attackers appears to be within the range of twelve to seventeen years."

Following the blood paths left by the dogs, the police encountered multiple bodies of babies and children left abandoned, many still bleeding, freshly killed. It turns out that the dogs have learned to sneak through the neighborhood walls through underground tunnels, find households and resources based on places set on fire by the pyro addicts, and attack at night in the darkness when guardians are resting. The dogs are fast and ruthless, and the vulnerable babies and young children have become their new target. Babies and children have been increasingly missing\u2014or killed, by the growing population of dogs. They are becoming the dogs' new feast. Guardians, households, and the wide community must watch out for this heartbreaking challenge. Stick together, have watchers at night, escape from the pack of dogs.

As a result, chaos has enveloped the city as rioters take advantage of the lack of security and steal anything in sight.

As people attempt to leave in the few vehicles left, rioters form blockades and kill anyone too unaware to stay inside and continue to drive through the mass of bodies. Gunfights can be heard everywhere. In an attempt to control the riots, the few remaining police forces threw gas into underground Atlanta, sealing off all exits and leaving the people below to suffocate amidst the chaos. Atlanta is no longer safe if it ever was. With the locals doing everything in their power to escape, it would be in everyone else\u2019s best interest to steer far from the refugees and destruction of Atlanta. "

We interviewed many individuals who stayed at the Sand Castle Inn, who experienced immense flooding on the first floor of their hotel rooms. Some were completely surprised and had no idea what to do and others had already planned to move north, to the mountains where they would be less at risk of the impacts of the sea levels rising. Climate change has made some places warmer, others colder, sea levels to rise, more frequent hurricanes and many other things. One family had purchased land and a home in the middle of Vermont, away from the ocean and any bodies of water. They explained to me that they knew that things were going to get bad because of the constant change in the environment and constant destruction. They wanted to get ahead of the time so that they wouldn't be trapped without anywhere to go anything. Others weren't so lucky, trapped in Tybee without anywhere to go, frustrated with the faults of the Earth that we humans had created. "

The rising water table has destabilized Florida's limestone bedrock, and causing massive sinkholes to emerge, especially in highly urbanized areas. As a result, the governor has implemented population caps, limiting the population size to one thousand people per square mile. These conflating factors have resulted in a mass exodus north. The local militias have organized caravans, charging people a fee for safe passage out of the state. Those who cannot afford to leave face a bevy of challenges: lack of groundwater which hasn't yet been contaminated by salt and algal blooms, violence from the militias and other inhabitants, lack of protection and safe infrastructure due to the population caps, and disease from the swarms of insects that have bred from the abundance of water and extreme temperatures. The greater Orlando area has become a major center for those displaced, expanding northward as residents move to accommodate the population caps and newcomers hope to find a group to caravan with."

                    "text": "Dodge City, Kansas, known for it's Wild West history, is now facing a challenging period.  A disease no one have heard of before, COVID-19 has devastated the community, causing severe shortages of healthcare professionals, a critical water shortage, and a chilling rise in violence. Despite the town's limited medical facilities, there aren't enough healthcare workers to deal with the surge in cases. Many of them feel helpless in the face of the crisis due to long shifts and losing patients every day. Adding to the difficulty, Dodge City has run out of water. Residents are fighting for a dwindling life source. Fights over resources are happening a lot more often and are getting violent, which is really concerning. Because they are desperate, the quest for survival has turned neighbors against one another. The neighborhood falls into chaos, similar to the lawlessness of the Wild West, because the local police, who are already overwhelmed, can't control the outbreaks of violence.There has never been a more pressing need for a solution than now, as Dodge City teeters on the verge of disintegration from its once cohesive community. A beacon of light in a world becoming dark, the town's screams for assistance are evocative to the cholera outbreak in Missippi, but as usual, the government couldn't care less. The community's ability to bounce back from this unprecedented challenge is put to the test, and the road to recovery is not clear.            <br><br> MAKE SURE YOU DODGE THAT COUGH!<br><br>"

To make matters worse, the tornado reached critical temperature causing severe burns and setting Topeka ablaze. The tornado featured winds of over 350 MPH, wrecking everything in its path. It is unknown how many people were killed in this devastating natural disaster, but the initial estimates are that over 90% of the people in the region were killed. This is not the first disaster to strike the heart of the country. Early this year, a tornado of similar size demolished Kansas City and left most of its population for dead. While the death count will be confirmed later this week, it is a grim and tragic day for the people of Topeka. A local correspondent spoke with a survivor of the tragic event. \"It was terrifying. I was inside my house when I heard screaming and strong winds. I was lucky to make it out alive and escape the tornado. The rest of my family were not so lucky. Where will I go now?\" Stay tuned for more updates as the death count is sure to rise. "

The drug has been widely known throughout the city to be the cause of multiple small house fires, and due to a severe lack of food and water across the board, many have turned to Ro as a last resort in order to feel some type of pleasure before their eventual demise. Sadly, this drug has run rampant in the Overland Park community, killing thousands and injuring an immense amount of impoverished folks in the city. The drug eventually made its way through the labourers to the families of the drivers, eventually leaving the city without structure or purpose. The police plan to collect the bodies of the dead before they are used for cannibalism--they were not able to help with the sheer amount of fires, and in an effort to demonstrate pity, the local police force is determined to properly bury and honor the deceased bodies. They have started the cleanup process with the wealthy, and they aim to gradually collect the bodies of the poor until the streets are clean. Some speculate that Overland Park will henceforth become a police center that will house training facilities and work as a police hub for other states in need of justice. However, the fate of Overland Park is largely unknown. <br><br>This story is breaking and will be updated soon."

While very closely related to the town name the devil worshipers have been described as deranged, murderous, and destructive. The individuals that were once human, turning into a Devil Worshiper are linked to a mutated strand of the Polio Virus that is derived from vaccines given in the early 90's. However, many of the individuals now known as devil worshipers derive their name from two actions. The first is performing satanic rituals with fire and consuming the lake's bloody water as part of their ritual. The second is their communication is in tongues and their need to infect other people through syringes, laced with cyanide, containing the polio vaccine. While the towns people speculate it is from consuming the devils bloody water the CDC has confirmed it is due to the polio vaccine. While the CDC expected symptoms such as paralysis, death, fever, or fatigue many individuals are experiencing irregular symptoms due to the waters influence."

Unfortunately for the farmers, their poor irrigation practices and general disregard for ecological sustainability have left the Ogallala Aquifer dangerously depleted. This aquifer, spanning seven states, is the main water reserve for most of the midwest and its grain farms. That it's out of water, with no way of being naturally replenished, spells disaster for the farmers, but also the rest of the United States. Grain prices have already skyrocketed, and before long the land will be so overworked, so dry, that nothing will be able to grow; a repeat of the dust bowl seems inevitable. Soon Bridgeport residents will run out of water, as the last of it is fought for by farmers and the rest of the population. I see the region's future: Barren and deserted, the wind spins tornados from a loom of cosmic wrath, and the few survivors left dig holes into the ground to avoid their self-imposed destiny. Route 26 going through Bridgeport, which seemed a blessing for their economy, will only bring hungry, desperate wanderers into the town's vicinity. Long after the last crops were pillages and the last people driven out, finally, maybe, rain will fall and soak and pound the earth down, and finally, maybe, wild grasses will grow again. "

However, not all have chosen to run away. Over 11,000 people have been estimated to be living under the streets of Denver, in sewers, utility basements, and even man-made tunnels. These people have been known, for almost a century, as mole people. Mole people is a term used to describe homeless people who live below ground. Moreover, this statistic has meant that Denver has become the leading city in terms of its mole people population. This recognition and title, however, has not meant good news for the city of Denver. With the population of mole people at an all time high and the number growing on a daily basis, the conditions of the underground structures in which these people reside in has deteriorated at an exponential rate. With cracks visible along the streets, sink holes appearing everyday, and foreshock-like trembles happening regularly, it is only a matter of time until these underground communities to be completely wiped out and destroyed."

Fanned by strong winds and fueled by the dry vegetation prevalent in the area, the flames rapidly spread, consuming everything in their path. As the fire rages unchecked, it engulfs not only the abandoned structures but also nearby homes, wildlife habitats, and vast stretches of the pristine forest that defines the landscape of Big Sky Country. The once-clear skies, which offered breathtaking views of the stars, are now obscured by thick smoke and ash, casting a pall over the region. The destruction wrought by the ongoing fires is staggering, with over 80% of the reservation and nearly 70% of Glacier National Parkland devastated by the inferno. In addition to the destruction of their habitats and neighborhoods, countless animals and people have perished in the flames. This fire marks the sixth this calendar year, which has rocked and demolished the county\u2019s national parks. There remains no effort to control the fire. Currently, there are no estimates of when the destruction will subside. "

Launch reports erupted at 11:34 AM August 31, 2027 from Kitsap Naval Base, Bangor, Washington. The White House has gone silent after this catastrophe and rumors are reported that high level personnel who would be responsible for this were allegedly drugged with pyro. The number of casualties are unreliable at the moment as we are only hours past the event. Life threatening damage has been reported to extend past 170 miles of the initial blast location, to locations past Salinas. These are only the preliminary reports. <br><br>10:56 AM September 1, 2027 - After nearly a day after the event, visual of the remains are able to be reported. Satellite images show that land within 10 miles of the initial detonation site has been erased. Casualty estimations are extending past 4.3 million as deaths are being reported in locations as for as 177 miles away. An upheaval of emotions from surviving victims of the tragedy are being seen online as demands for who is responsible are made. It is advised for survivors within 200 miles of San Francisco to evacuate their homes to avoid nuclear fallout and the upsurge of violence following the detonation. More to come later this afternoon.

I will not stand by idly as drug-fueled mobs of anti-American terrorists destroy our country.

This storm destroyed houses, and the ones it didn\u2019t destroy it completely covered in dirt and dust. <br><br>Many homeowners were not able to leave, or more appropriately escape, their homes.

With temperatures reaching 120 degrees on a regular basis, this city is the last place you want to travel to when there is a water shortage. People often die due to dehydration or heatstroke. Since the collapse of society, the population of Phoenix has resorted to theft and acts of violence in order to compete for the city's limited resources. These actions are only worsened by the heat which is said to leave people in delirious states that cause even more violence. We highly recommend staying far from the city and finding more rural alternatives where resources are less scarce. Due to the dangers the city poses, the group at the office has decided to rank Phoenix as a 3/10 in overall survival score.

The tiny island had been sinking at an imperceptible rate for years, when the combined effects of the pacific ocean earthquakes and the heatwaves of the late twenty-tens caused it to begin sinking at an alarmingly rapid pace. The final tip of the island was reported to be fully submerged by 22:17. Because of the last inhabitants of Kaho\u2019olawe\u2019s inability to quickly call the coast guard, twelve people have unfortunately perished. It was young  Stacy Mcdonald (21) who finally alerted authorities from her fishing boat off the coast of Maui. Stacy reported to have seen at least two small lifeboats relaying survivors off of the island moments after it was submerged. The survivors now reside on Maui, Hawaii's second largest island, which is projected to sink in the early twenty-forty\u2019s. Kaho\u2019olawe\u2019s sinking marks the sixteenth island to have sunk within the past five years. Will all dry land eventually sink? How long do we have?

As an island in the Pacific Ocean, Oahu, where Honolulu is located, is far away from the mainland of the United States. It is difficult for the continental United States to support the Honolulu wildfire. Affected by wildfires, the city of Honolulu, which relies on tourism as an important economic income, has been hit hard, and the income of local residents has dropped sharply. The economic stagnation has sent prices soaring in Honolulu. Residents cannot afford the high prices, and robberies and thefts occur frequently. Since public resources are mostly invested in fighting wildfires, the efficiency of public security has declined, further fueling the arrogance of criminals."
