			"text": "The second half of <em>Parable of the Sower</em> is a road novel, recounting Lauren's journey north across a hellish dystopian landscape. While we get glimpses of the rest of the United States in 2027 (for example, the fictional town of Olivar), we have only a vague sense of how different parts of the country are falling apart. What's happening in the Northeast? What about the Southeast? The American Southwest? The Midwest, the prairie states, the Rockies?<br><br>This activity asks you to imagine a single location—a city, town, or rural area—in the United States and describe a newsworthy event there that encapsulates the broader experience of that place. Similar to the <q>missing</q> journal activity, this activity asks you to enrich the world of Parable of the Sower by imagining events not depicted in the novel but which fit that world."

The park features a dazzling waterfall, with a pedestrian bridge crossing the Reedy River just downstream. But, recently the once beloved Reedy River has been a source of sickness and death. The water is infected with a parasite, Giardia intestinalis, or Giardia, which causes diarrhea and vomiting, which leads to dehydration and in some cases, death. Because of worsening water quality and lack of access to purification methods. there have been at least 200 cases of Giardia in the Downtown Greenville area alone. the infection has primarily affected children, as they unknowingly drink from the waterfalls and contract the parasite. Prices of antibiotics are skyrocketing as the death toll climbs higher each day. "

Deaths have been reported but no exact number has been confirmed. <br><br>Lucama, a small town just fifty miles east of Raleigh, North Carolina, was believed to have been targeted by individuals under the influence of the drug known as Pyro. The drug is known for heightening users' pleasure when watching fires burn by increasing their desire to start fires. <br><br>The fires consumed most of the town, destroying the few homes and businesses that were still standing. No record of the number of inhabitants in Lucama prior to the fires exists, making it unclear how many possible survivors there could be given the suspected number of deaths. <br><br>Surprisingly, out of everything that was consumed by the fire, several large metal art structures remained untouched. These art pieces, as referred to as by one police officer on the scene, are colorful structures made from scrap metal and machine parts, with all of them functioning similarly to a pinwheel toy.  <br><br>The same police officer stated that the reflective parts of some of the metal art pieces most likely added to the sensation these individuals were feeling as they were setting the fires.  <br><br>\u201cThe light reflecting onto these metal art structures that are standing up to fifty feet tall must\u2019ve captivated them in some way,\u201d The officer said. He added that this is what most likely put them off from setting the art pieces on fire. There is concern, however, that the culprits will come back, seeking the added sensation from the art pieces. Efforts are in talk to dismantle the metal structures. "

As part of an effort to curb unnecessary federal spending, the Butner Federal Medical Center (FMC), residing on the ground of the Butner Federal Correctional Institution, received its check. With limited money to continue operations, the FMC will close its doors on November 1. A spokesperson from Butner Federal Correctional Institution did not respond to comment when asked about the future awaiting patients from the FMC. Operational since 1995, the Federal Medical Center serviced notable inmates ranging from John Hinckley Jr., to Bernie Madoff, to Theodore Kaczynski. Julius Graham, professor of Law & Society at Duke University views the closure as \u201ca clear sign the federal government no longer views incarceration as restorative in any sense of the word, if it ever did. Now, President Donner has essentially doomed millions of prisoners to inhumane deaths by treatable conditions.\u201d In his radio statement, Donner praised Congress for \u201cpassing a bill that will finally divert money to the American people and not to those unfit for society.\u201d"

In his statement regarding his decision to bomb San Francisco, President Donner said “After 130 days of heavy casualties on both sides, against no one enemy or leader, it is clear that we must attack this weed at its root. I will not stand by idly as drug-fueled mobs of anti-American terrorists destroy our country. The American way is to rebuild, in that spirit, our top priority will be rebuilding San Francisco, and expanding this program nationally!” Following his statement, Donner issued an Executive Order which establishes a system to rank the moral standing of populations, by city, to determine whether deploying the National Guard would restore order. Critics warn that government’s decision to exercise military force on their own citizens would set a bad precedent, but Sandra Power, Professor of Human Rights at Harvard, and the President’s Chief Advisor on the National Security Council, dismissed these concerns saying, “We have to save the children; it is the most humane thing to do.” "

The tiny island had been sinking at an imperceptible rate for years, when the combined effects of the pacific ocean earthquakes and the heatwaves of the late twenty-tens caused it to begin sinking at an alarmingly rapid pace. The final tip of the island was reported to be fully submerged by 22:17. Because of the last inhabitants of Kaho’olawe’s inability to quickly call the coast guard, twelve people have unfortunately perished. It was young  Stacy Mcdonald (21) who finally alerted authorities from her fishing boat off the coast of Maui. Stacy reported to have seen at least two small lifeboats relaying survivors off of the island moments after it was submerged. The survivors now reside on Maui, Hawaii's second largest island, which is projected to sink in the early twenty-forty’s. Kaho’olawe’s sinking marks the sixteenth island to have sunk within the past five years. Will all dry land eventually sink? How long do we have? Should we be seeking high land in preparation? Only time will tell. "

Thousands of people lost their homes and jobs which left the population of New Orleans to be cut in half. Those individuals who stayed faced the economic challenges of living in poverty-stricken communities which continued with Hurricane Laura in 2020. Political issues have not helped the state of the city either. Poverty has left the city in shambles with everyone turning to crime. Homicide levels have increased to the point where Louisiana State Penitentiary has filled up with more inmates than officers. This week prisoners have revolted killing all officers while escaping the 18,000-acre prison. The prisoners have headed to New Orleans as the epicenter of their future endeavors. Their freedom has allowed them to steal and kill anyone who will get in their way. With over 7,000 prisoners who have escaped, New Orleans has become a city full of chaos and death rather than the city that once was known as being rich in culture and music.Once again, Louisiana State Penitentiary has been renamed as America's Bloodiest Prison. The future of Louisiana is uncertain but soon enough Hurricane Loma will hit causing new problems for New Orleans. "

She said, “I am amazed at how close the community has remained throughout all of this strife. I am always reminded that we are all neighbors and we are all trying to survive.” The cholera outbreak started about two months ago and has spread while the community has tried to contain and purify any remaining contaminated food and water. The tornados that have sprung up this week have added to the number of people left homeless, sick, and in need of resources. Virginia has lost all semblance of state maintained infrastructure, so it is up to individual communities to stay together and take care of maintenance and necessities. Maria Nicely’s statements are a reminder of how fortunate our community is to be so small and out of the way. Being tucked in the mountains and already very close knit has allowed us to survive thus far. Even with these outbreaks and natural disasters, the community will persevere."

Today we went outside of the walls surrounding the hospital we’ve been calling home for the past 2 years. The goal is to go beyond the miles our eyes can see and gather information on the nature and land we still have left. The news brought back was devastating. The reporters believe that 90 percent of the land has been burned down.

Following the blood paths left by the dogs, the police encountered multiple bodies of babies and children left abandoned, many still bleeding, freshly killed. It turns out that the dogs have learned to sneak through the neighborhood walls through underground tunnels, find households and resources based on places set on fire by the pyro addicts, and attack at night in the darkness when guardians are resting. The dogs are fast and ruthless, and the vulnerable babies and young children have become their new target. Babies and children have been increasingly missing—or killed, by the growing population of dogs. They are becoming the dogs' new feast. Guardians, households, and the wide community must watch out for this heartbreaking challenge. Stick together, have watchers at night, escape from the pack of dogs. Experts suggest for families to move up North, away from Guntersville, Alabama, where the pack of dogs have not become a significant source of danger, yet."

I see the region's future: Barren and deserted, the wind spins tornados from a loom of cosmic wrath, and the few survivors left dig holes into the ground to avoid their self-imposed destiny. Route 26 going through Bridgeport, which seemed a blessing for their economy, will only bring hungry, desperate wanderers into the town's vicinity. Long after the last crops were pillages and the last people driven out, finally, maybe, rain will fall and soak and pound the earth down, and finally, maybe, wild grasses will grow again."

Parts of the year leave the Florida landscape scorched. This combined with the development of logging companies has left vast swaths of Florida a desolate wasteland. When the seasons change, these wastelands are home to unnumbered stagnant pools that act as spawning grounds for mosquitos. The remaining wealthy communities and surrounding slums inhabiting what is left off the coast of Miami are suffering from a constant bombardment of black swarms of mosquitoes coming in from a short distance inland. Nile fever is rampant within the mostly unvaccinated community being hit hard with many worried about a rising number of malaria cases. Those who can afford it are beginning to flee much further North while the less fortunate are beginning to migrate in droves to Alabama and Georgia. The government has taken action setting up defenses along highways to “filter” those allowed to travel North. It is expected that large camps will begin to spring up along the border where living conditions are sure to cause more death and disease. "

The rising water table has destabilized Florida's limestone bedrock, and causing massive sinkholes to emerge, especially in highly urbanized areas. As a result, the governor has implemented population caps, limiting the population size to one thousand people per square mile. These conflating factors have resulted in a mass exodus north. The local militias have organized caravans, charging people a fee for safe passage out of the state. Those who cannot afford to leave face a bevy of challenges: lack of groundwater which hasn't yet been contaminated by salt and algal blooms, violence from the militias and other inhabitants, lack of protection and safe infrastructure due to the population caps, and disease from the swarms of insects that have bred from the abundance of water and extreme temperatures. The greater Orlando area has become a major center for those displaced, expanding northward as residents move to accommodate the population caps and newcomers hope to find a group to caravan with."

It is clogged with fallen trees, logs, and the littered trash of people wandering through the town. The old, drinkable water has become so greatly polluted it can no longer be consumed. Although if you are brave enough or desperate enough and try to drink the water, water should be boiled or water purification tablets should be used. Drink with caution.<br><br>The crime in Spirit Lake has over doubled in the past year. Many of the restaurants and stores have been looted and burned, and ash remains where they once lay. Resources are so low people have resorted to cannibalism. Yesterday, a human body was found next to a campfire. Its right leg was missing and the bone gnawed. There was a clean slit down the left leg and all that left was skin and bone. If you are passing through Spirit Lake, be careful."

Detrimental monsoons have eroded many buildings' infrastructure, and most who reside in the submerged districts likely have only a few months to live before it all crumbles down.<br><br>Recently, though, due to a lack of transportation, residents have turned to each other for sustenance, wealth, and entertainment. Entire buildings have been dwindled to two or three cannibalistic groups. In some buildings, cannibal groups gather seven or eight people and force them to complete meaningless tasks for their survival, eliminating and eating them one at a time. There are no winners. Eventually once all have been labored to insanity and subsequently eaten, a new batch is brought in. <br><br>Luckily, those who live in the submerged districts are protected from the Paints, who now wander aimlessly on the barren outskirts searching for anything to burn. In fact, the Paints in the Boston area have taken a distinct pleasure in burning hundreds of humans at a time. They chain up survivors, families, law enforcement—-anything they can get their hands on—and organize a mass burn of human flesh. <br><Br>Nobody wants to rescue anyone in the submerged district, or even enter the city at all. With the new outbreak of cannibalism, the few “good” souls left in Boston must accept that they are predestined for death."

As a result, chaos has enveloped the city as rioters take advantage of the lack of security and steal anything in sight. The already minimal police force can simply not keep up or have become rioters themselves as the gangs that bribe most of them have begun to take over. As people attempt to leave in the few vehicles left, rioters form blockades and kill anyone too unaware to stay inside and continue to drive through the mass of bodies. Gunfights can be heard everywhere. In an attempt to control the riots, the few remaining police forces threw gas into underground Atlanta, sealing off all exits and leaving the people below to suffocate amidst the chaos. Atlanta is no longer safe if it ever was. With the locals doing everything in their power to escape, it would be in everyone else’s best interest to steer far from the refugees and destruction of Atlanta. "

As they traveled up North, often trying to reach Canada, wanderers stayed close to the lake’s shores. In addition to providing those with a clear route, Lake Michigan’s water gave a chance for survival. <br><br>Of course, this body of water has been contaminated ever since significant numbers of citizens began their northern treks. With no standardized place to use the restroom, the body of water was a natural choice. But now, the issue has turned extreme. A new disease, which is able to withstand all decontamination efforts—purification tablets, boiling, etc—has taken the lives of thousands. The first case was seen in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, a city one hour by car from Milwaukee. At first, many thought the illness to be cholera, but new symptoms have proven the disease to be a new mutation.

The resulting short-range explosion left all within the facility dead, and the fallout released spread in an estimated elliptical radius, extending up to twelve miles northwards and eight miles towards the south. Officials are advising against leaving shelter for another few days. Presently, three days after the incident, the highest estimated death counts are in Davidson and just west of Cornelius. Researchers speculate this to be because of the good weather increasing a characteristically high quantity of pedestrian traffic, combined with many Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools being out for summer. While currently unclear, at least five hundred deaths have been reported and this number is expected to rise dramatically as more individuals experience acute radiation poisoning. The delayed warnings and sirens are currently under investigation and are presently attributed to equipment malfunction. Officials are increasing the security at the Catawba Duke Nuclear Plant in fear of copycat attacks, while the motive of the original group is unclear. The bodies have yet to be found and recovered, but footage suggests that they used a combination of homebrew incendiaries and explosives. "

Dr. Lory Dale, once part of the Food and Drug Administration, explained her reasoning to us in an interview last Thursday within the previously defunct Kennywood Theme Park. 'Pyro addicts have wreaked havoc on this country, and I'm not trying to defend any of what they've done. But what people don't realize is a lot of them are kids looking for a way to make something for themselves with what little power they feel they have, even if that means burning everything to the ground. Whether they want community, power, or some combination of both, they take the pill. We're here to provide a way out.' Dale took us to Musical Express, a spinning carousel of flashing lights and exciting music. From where we stood, we could see some addicts on board, screaming and singing along, but no fires. 'It's too expensive to run the full park with the security and other expenses' Dale continued, 'but as long as we get the flashier rides going and keep a couple of 'break' rooms for those craving bigger hits, it works. But I want to make this clear: it is a lot less expensive to prevent these things than to try and ease them later. There is still a lot of work to be done.'"
