			"text": "The second half of <em>Parable of the Sower</em> is a road novel, recounting Lauren's journey north across a hellish dystopian landscape. While we get glimpses of the rest of the United States in 2027 (for example, the fictional town of Olivar), we have only a vague sense of how different parts of the country are falling apart. What's happening in the Northeast? What about the Southeast? The American Southwest? The Midwest, the prairie states, the Rockies?<br><br>This activity asks you to imagine a single location—a city, town, or rural area—in the United States and describe a newsworthy event there that encapsulates the broader experience of that place. Similar to the <q>missing</q> journal activity, this activity asks you to enrich the world of Parable of the Sower by imagining events not depicted in the novel but which fit that world."

The park features a dazzling waterfall, with a pedestrian bridge crossing the Reedy River just downstream. But, recently the once beloved Reedy River has been a source of sickness and death. The water is infected with a parasite, Giardia intestinalis, or Giardia, which causes diarrhea and vomiting, which leads to dehydration and in some cases, death. Because of worsening water quality and lack of access to purification methods. there have been at least 200 cases of Giardia in the Downtown Greenville area alone. the infection has primarily affected children, as they unknowingly drink from the waterfalls and contract the parasite. Prices of antibiotics are skyrocketing as the death toll climbs higher each day. "

Deaths have been reported but no exact number has been confirmed. <br><br>Lucama, a small town just fifty miles east of Raleigh, North Carolina, was believed to have been targeted by individuals under the influence of the drug known as Pyro. The drug is known for heightening users' pleasure when watching fires burn by increasing their desire to start fires. <br><br>The fires consumed most of the town, destroying the few homes and businesses that were still standing. No record of the number of inhabitants in Lucama prior to the fires exists, making it unclear how many possible survivors there could be given the suspected number of deaths. <br><br>Surprisingly, out of everything that was consumed by the fire, several large metal art structures remained untouched. These art pieces, as referred to as by one police officer on the scene, are colorful structures made from scrap metal and machine parts, with all of them functioning similarly to a pinwheel toy.  <br><br>The same police officer stated that the reflective parts of some of the metal art pieces most likely added to the sensation these individuals were feeling as they were setting the fires.  <br><br>\u201cThe light reflecting onto these metal art structures that are standing up to fifty feet tall must\u2019ve captivated them in some way,\u201d The officer said. He added that this is what most likely put them off from setting the art pieces on fire. There is concern, however, that the culprits will come back, seeking the added sensation from the art pieces. Efforts are in talk to dismantle the metal structures. "

As part of an effort to curb unnecessary federal spending, the Butner Federal Medical Center (FMC), residing on the ground of the Butner Federal Correctional Institution, received its check. With limited money to continue operations, the FMC will close its doors on November 1. A spokesperson from Butner Federal Correctional Institution did not respond to comment when asked about the future awaiting patients from the FMC. Operational since 1995, the Federal Medical Center serviced notable inmates ranging from John Hinckley Jr., to Bernie Madoff, to Theodore Kaczynski. Julius Graham, professor of Law & Society at Duke University views the closure as \u201ca clear sign the federal government no longer views incarceration as restorative in any sense of the word, if it ever did. Now, President Donner has essentially doomed millions of prisoners to inhumane deaths by treatable conditions.\u201d In his radio statement, Donner praised Congress for \u201cpassing a bill that will finally divert money to the American people and not to those unfit for society.\u201d"

This marks the 4th consecutive year that the already tattered potato industry has experienced a net loss in potato production. Many farmers are now moving northward, abandoning acres of once fertile land to the dust storms that now blight the terrain in warmer months. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing for us here,\u201d said Rick Hutchins, 64, who spent his whole life harvesting and planting in Snake River Plain. <br><br>\tThough sparsely populated before the collapse, the potato belt was nonetheless subject to an economic paradigm shift: today, farmers no longer farm for money, they farm for food. And if much, or worse all of their crops continue to fail, farmers will have no food to put on the table. For anyone. Period. <br><br>\tNEW in SCIENCE: President Donner authorizes a new government sanctioned bioengineering program. Using carbon capture technology, the partner organization \u201cClearSkye\u201d will pilot a fleet of low-earth-orbit satellites to deploy a web of heat-resistant foil to filter and extract carbon from the upper atmosphere.

In his statement regarding his decision to bomb San Francisco, President Donner said “After 130 days of heavy casualties on both sides, against no one enemy or leader, it is clear that we must attack this weed at its root. I will not stand by idly as drug-fueled mobs of anti-American terrorists destroy our country. The American way is to rebuild, in that spirit, our top priority will be rebuilding San Francisco, and expanding this program nationally!” Following his statement, Donner issued an Executive Order which establishes a system to rank the moral standing of populations, by city, to determine whether deploying the National Guard would restore order. Critics warn that government’s decision to exercise military force on their own citizens would set a bad precedent, but Sandra Power, Professor of Human Rights at Harvard, and the President’s Chief Advisor on the National Security Council, dismissed these concerns saying, “We have to save the children; it is the most humane thing to do.” "

The tiny island had been sinking at an imperceptible rate for years, when the combined effects of the pacific ocean earthquakes and the heatwaves of the late twenty-tens caused it to begin sinking at an alarmingly rapid pace. The final tip of the island was reported to be fully submerged by 22:17. Because of the last inhabitants of Kaho’olawe’s inability to quickly call the coast guard, twelve people have unfortunately perished. It was young  Stacy Mcdonald (21) who finally alerted authorities from her fishing boat off the coast of Maui. Stacy reported to have seen at least two small lifeboats relaying survivors off of the island moments after it was submerged. The survivors now reside on Maui, Hawaii's second largest island, which is projected to sink in the early twenty-forty’s. Kaho’olawe’s sinking marks the sixteenth island to have sunk within the past five years. Will all dry land eventually sink? How long do we have? Should we be seeking high land in preparation? Only time will tell. "

If you thought Hurricane Katrina wasn’t enough for this city, you’ll think once again about what had just happened. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, New Orleans was flooded. Thousands of people lost their homes and jobs which left the population of New Orleans to be cut in half. Those individuals who stayed faced the economic challenges of living in poverty-stricken communities which continued with Hurricane Laura in 2020. Political issues have not helped the state of the city either. Poverty has left the city in shambles with everyone turning to crime. Homicide levels have increased to the point where Louisiana State Penitentiary has filled up with more inmates than officers. This week prisoners have revolted killing all officers while escaping the 18,000-acre prison. The prisoners have headed to New Orleans as the epicenter of their future endeavors. Their freedom has allowed them to steal and kill anyone who will get in their way. With over 7,000 prisoners who have escaped, New Orleans has become a city full of chaos and death rather than the city that once was known as being rich in culture and music.Once again, Louisiana State Penitentiary has been renamed as America's Bloodiest Prison. The future of Louisiana is uncertain but soon enough Hurricane Loma will hit causing new problems for New Orleans. "

She said, “I am amazed at how close the community has remained throughout all of this strife. I am always reminded that we are all neighbors and we are all trying to survive.” The cholera outbreak started about two months ago and has spread while the community has tried to contain and purify any remaining contaminated food and water. The tornados that have sprung up this week have added to the number of people left homeless, sick, and in need of resources. Virginia has lost all semblance of state maintained infrastructure, so it is up to individual communities to stay together and take care of maintenance and necessities. Maria Nicely’s statements are a reminder of how fortunate our community is to be so small and out of the way. Being tucked in the mountains and already very close knit has allowed us to survive thus far. Even with these outbreaks and natural disasters, the community will persevere."
